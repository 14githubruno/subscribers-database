## Subscription simulation

This project's aim was to experiment with backend development, that is Node, Express and MongoDB.

On the client side, a form allows users to submit their own data (among which their email address) through fetch API. On the server side, instead, data are parsed and eventually stored in MongoDB through Mongoose. If the storage is successful, users receive an email (to their submitted email address) through Nodemailer.
